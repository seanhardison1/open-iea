# Defining open science

"...free and unfettered access to all stages of the scientific endeavor" - *Hampton et al. 2015*

???
In the 2015 paper aptly named the Tao of Open Science for Ecology, Hampton et al. suggest that it's the free and unfettered access to all stages of the scientific endeavor. 

This includes the methods use in design of experiements, the source and derived data sets from which inferences were made, and also the provenance of data sets through processing and analysis stages. These tools help scientists and interested stakeholders understand how we came to the conclusions we did given the data we had. Further, while less important for the examples I'll be discussing today, a key aspect of open science is that the final products themselves be made freely available.

The Ocean Health Index uses a standard framework for assessing the health of marine ecosystems around the world. 

Ecosystem health is based on goals developed in partnership with local experts and stakeholders

The many interacting components in integrated ecosystem assessments and the subset of ecosystem reporting present several challenges that we think can be efficiently addressed using open data science tools.

# Programmatic efficiencies to manage workloads 

**Ecosystem reports can be modular and automated (to a certain extent)**

1) SOE data are aggregated into the **ecodata R package**

# Programmatic efficiencies to manage workloads

**Ecosystem reports can be modular and automated (to a certain extent)**

2) SOE reports are written as Rmarkdown documents, making use of the ecodata package.

3) Data are processed and structures are the same, meaning (very similar) figure code can be applied across projects.

```{r, echo = F, fig.align = "center", out.width = "75%"}

# Managing data provenance

Leveraging Travis CI, a **continuous integration** software, with Github and Rmarkdown documents

```{r, echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("images/tech_doc_CI.png")
```

SOE reports, ecodata, and technical documentation hosted on Github

???
With data from so many different sources, ensuring that the processing and analytical steps taken to move from source data to derived product are open and easy to follow is difficult. 

To address this challenge, we linked processing code from our ecodata package to our technical documentation, so that anytime our processing code is updated, it's automatically scraped into the technical document. This process ensures that provenance on our end is up to date.

# Conclusions and lessons learned

* A network of dependent products related to ecosystem reporting has increased the communication, transparency, and reproducibility of our documents. 

* Management and collaborators find accessibility to be a major improvement
